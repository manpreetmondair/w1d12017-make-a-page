            <h1>Growth of women in technology</h1>
                <p>Tech has always been a predominantly male industry, with iconic male entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg gaining the most recognition for their contributions to the sector. However, women are playing a huge part too and more and more women are entering both regular and high level positions in tech, with the big global firms such as Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. hiring women 238% faster than men.

               <h1>Interesting factors of women in technology</h1>
                 <p>While engineering and computer-related fields as some of the fastest growing fields in the United States, women only hold about one-quarter or less of those positions.U.S. women working in science and high-tech fields are 45 percent more likely than their male peers to leave the industry within a year, often due to gender bias and feelings that they are being weighed against male counterparts.The average percentage of women working in the tech industry is 30%, based on diversity reports published by 11 of the world's largest tech companies in 2014.In the mid-1980s, 37% of computer science majors were women; in 2012, 18%.Women only earn about 12% of computer science degrees nationally.
